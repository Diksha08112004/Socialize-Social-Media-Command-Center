## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### Required: Set Up Firebase (5 minutes)

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Create a new project

2. **Enable Firestore Database**
   - Start in test mode (for development)

3. **Get Your Config**
   - Register a web app
   - Copy the Firebase configuration

4. **Update Your App**
   - Open `src/firebase/config.js`
   - Replace placeholder values with your actual Firebase config

5. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Detailed Guides Available:

- **Quick Start**: See `QUICK_START.md` (5 minutes)
- **Detailed Guide**: See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` (complete instructions)

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Before (localStorage):
```
User adds post → Saved to browser → Lost if browser cleared
```

### After (Firebase):
```
User adds post → Saved to Cloud → Permanent & accessible anywhere
```

## 📊 Database Operations

All database operations are handled in `src/services/postService.js`:

- **`addPost(postData)`** - Add new post to Firestore
- **`getPosts()`** - Fetch all posts from Firestore
- **`deletePost(postId)`** - Delete a post from Firestore

## 🔒 Security

- Firebase config is safe to expose in frontend code
- For production, update Firestore security rules
- Use environment variables for better security (optional)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

After basic setup works, you can:

1. **Add Authentication** - Let users sign in
2. **Real-time Sync** - See updates instantly across devices
3. **User-specific Posts** - Each user sees only their posts
4. **Deploy to Production** - Host on Firebase Hosting or Netlify
